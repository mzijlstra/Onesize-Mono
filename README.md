# Onesize-Mono
Monospace version of the Onesize font by Yuji Saiki.

From what I read, this font was used (or a font that looks a lot like it) when creating the early SCUMM games.

As far as I could also see the font was freely licesed, therefore allowing me to adapt it.

I really wanted to use this font in my terminal, but it wasn't monospace... So I went and got FontForge and changed the spacing around some of the characters (luckily they were mostly the same already). I just had to take some blank space away from the widest characters, and add some blank space to the narrowest.

I greatly enjoy using it, and I'm happy to share the fruits of my labor.
